## Edwardsiid Genomes Paper Code

This project contains the code used in creating most of the figures in the 
paper [Sea anemone genomes reveal ancestral metazoan chromosomal macrosynteny](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.359448v2). 
The `figures/` contains scripts that correspond to the figures in the manuscript, 
which utilizes much of the code contained in the package (in `R/`). The data
should be placed in a directory called `data/` at the top of the project
directory. This can be retrieved in a yet-to-be established supplemental
data repository. The file [RUNNING.md](RUNNING.md) contains instructions on
how to reproduce the figures in the manuscript, as well as some guidance on
the way the assembly of the genome is generated and analyses were performed.
