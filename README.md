## Edwardsiid Genomes Paper Code

This project contains the code used in creating most of the figures in the
paper [Topological structures and syntenic conservation in sea anemone genomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44080-7).

- The `vis/` contains scripts that correspond to the figures in the manuscript, which utilizes much of the code contained in the package (in `R/`).
- The data should be placed in a directory called `data/` at the top of the project directory. This can be retrieved via figshare at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24258598.v2.
- The file [RUNNING.md](RUNNING.md) contains instructions on how to reproduce the figures in the manuscript, as well as some guidance on
  the way the assembly of the genome is generated and analyses were performed, as well as a description of the `scripts/` directory.
